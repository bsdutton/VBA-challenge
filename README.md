# VBA-challenge
Homework 2

### SOLUTIONS
* Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm is solution spreadsheet
* alphabetical_testing - LAST.xlsm is the main file the code was tested on first
* alphabetical_testing (1).xlsm is another working file code was tested on.	
  * It also worked as a backup for VBA modules.

### SCREENSHOTS
* All screenshots are saved in the folder titled "Screenshots of the results"
* All screenshots are print to PDFs of the Excel file.
* Print to PDFs were taken of all six sheets for the alphabetical_testing - LAST.xlsm file.
* The six sheets were saved individually, and they were also combined into one PDF.
  * alphabetical_testing - LAST - ALL SIX SHEETS.pdf
* Print to PDF were done of the top and bottom of each worksheet for the Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm
  * Since each summary table was so long.

### CAVEATS
* In order to get the Bonus solutions
  * I added to my code to get the Greatest % Increase, the Greatest % Decrease, and the Greatest Volume of trades.
  * I extended my Summary Table Columns for the Percent Change and Total Stock Volume.
  * I got the MIN and MAX values and had them added to the end of each column for each worksheet.
  * I tried to write code to have put all the results in a separate summary table on the first worksheet, but this seemed more than what the Bonus asked for.
  * For now, I simply input the results on the first worksheet.
  * I need to try more with Worksheet ranges.
  * I need to see if I can make the Offset ranges work, also.

### MORE NOTES
* I left the MIN and MAX code in my alphabetical_testing files for finding the MIN and MAX trades for each ticker symbol.
	* I felt this was another look at Percentage Change for each stock.
	* It would reflect the volatility of the stocks over the entire year rather than looking at the opening trade
	* and the closing trade.
	* I got the results for to work for these MIN and MAX, and they would have been in the yearly_change1 and
	* percentage_change1 columns; but, they are commented out.
